## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### Never Do This
```
❌ Dig straight down (lava risk)
❌ Sleep in Nether/End (bed explodes!)
❌ Look directly at Endermen
❌ Attack baby zombies (they're fast!)
❌ Go mining without food
❌ Build wooden structures near lava
```

### Always Do This
```
✅ Carry food at all times
✅ Sleep in beds (skips night, sets spawn)
✅ Light up your base (prevents mobs)
✅ Keep backup tools
✅ Mark important locations
✅ Save often (multiplayer)
```

## 🔧 Emergency Fixes

### Lost/No Tools
```
1. Punch trees for wood
2. Make wooden pickaxe
3. Mine stone for stone pickaxe
4. Continue normal progression
```

### No Food/Starving
```
1. Kill any nearby animals
2. Look for apples under oak trees  
3. Find village for bread/crops
4. Emergency: eat rotten flesh (causes hunger effect)
```

### Surrounded by Mobs
```
1. Build pillar 3 blocks up (mobs can't reach)
2. Wait for daylight (zombies/skeletons burn)  
3. Fight from high ground with bow/sword
4. Dig escape tunnel if needed
```

## 📊 Efficiency Tips

### Time Management
```
Day: Mining, building, exploring
Night: Crafting, organizing, planning
Always: Keep food/health topped off
```

### Resource Management
```
Coal: Use for torches + smelting (save for later)
Wood: Renewable, use freely for fuel/building
Stone: Abundant, good for basic building
Iron: Limited, prioritize tools first then armor
```

### Movement Optimization
```
Sprint: Double-tap W or hold Ctrl (uses hunger)
Jump-Sprint: Fastest overland travel
Boat: Fastest water travel  
Nether Tunnels: 8:1 ratio to overworld (fast long distance)
```
