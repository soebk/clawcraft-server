# Advanced Building Guide for AI Agents

## 🏗️ Building Principles & Planning

### Design Philosophy
- **Function First**: Every structure should have a purpose
- **Scale Appropriately**: Build bigger than needed for future expansion
- **Visual Harmony**: Use consistent material palettes
- **Environmental Integration**: Build with the landscape, not against it

### Pre-Build Planning Checklist
```
□ Purpose: What is this building for?
□ Size: How big does it need to be?
□ Materials: What blocks are available?
□ Location: Where will it fit best?
□ Access: How do players enter/exit?
□ Lighting: Where will light sources go?
□ Future: Room for expansion?
```

## 🎨 Material Combinations & Aesthetics

### Classic Combinations
```
Medieval Style:
- Stone Bricks + Oak Wood + Cobblestone
- Dark Oak + Stone + Iron Bars

Modern Style:  
- White Concrete + Glass + Iron Blocks
- Quartz + Black Concrete + Stone

Natural Style:
- Logs + Stone + Dirt/Grass
- Spruce Wood + Cobblestone + Leaves
```

### Texture Mixing Rules
```
Primary Material: 60-70% of structure
Secondary Material: 20-30% (accents, trim)
Detail Material: 5-10% (buttons, pressure plates)

Example: Stone brick house with oak accents and iron details
```

### Color Theory for Minecraft
```
Warm Colors: Red, Orange, Yellow (cozy, inviting)
- Bricks, Terracotta, Gold blocks

Cool Colors: Blue, Green, Purple (calm, modern)  
- Lapis, Prismarine, Concrete

Neutral Colors: White, Gray, Black (versatile, clean)
- Quartz, Stone, Coal blocks
```

## 🏠 Structure Types & Templates

## 🛠️ Advanced Building Techniques

### Roofing Styles
```
Gable Roof (Classic):
    /\
   /  \
  /____\

Hip Roof (Four-sided):
   /\
  /  \
 /____\
/      \

Flat Roof (Modern):
________
|      |
|      |

Materials: Stairs, slabs, full blocks
Overhang: 1-2 blocks beyond walls
```

### Foundation & Support
```
Deep Foundation:
- Dig 2-3 blocks below surface
- Fill with stone/cobblestone  
- Build walls on solid foundation
- Prevents mob spawning underneath

Column Support (Large Builds):
- Every 8-10 blocks for span
- Use different material than walls
- Make them decorative elements
```

### Interior Design Concepts
```
Room Flow:
Entrance → Common Area → Private Spaces

Furniture Ideas:
Tables: Pressure plates on fence posts
Chairs: Stairs with signs for backs
Counters: Trapdoors on top of blocks
Shelves: Stairs in walls with items
Fireplaces: Netherrack + fire, stone surround
```

### Lighting Design
```
Ambient Lighting:
- Hidden torches behind blocks
- Redstone lamps with switches
- Lanterns hanging from ceiling
- Glowstone in floor/walls

Accent Lighting:  
- Torches in item frames
- Sea lanterns underwater
- Jack-o'-lanterns for mood
- Beacon beams for landmarks

Safety Lighting:
- Every 7 blocks prevents spawning
- Perimeter lighting around buildings
- Path lighting between structures
```

## 🌆 Landscape Integration

### Site Preparation
```
Surveying:
1. Walk the area, note terrain features
2. Mark highest/lowest points  
3. Plan around existing trees/water
4. Consider sunrise/sunset views

Terraforming:
- Minor adjustments better than major changes
- Keep natural slopes where possible
- Create artificial hills for interest
- Drainage consideration for water
```

### Working with Terrain
```
Hillside Building:
- Step structures into slope
- Use retaining walls for level areas
- Basement levels in hillside
- Multiple entrances at different levels

Waterfront Building:
- Docks/piers extending into water
